simple: Simple setup scenario
=============================

This is your typical small project, with:

.. [[end long_description]]

- ``name`` is deduced from ``__title__`` in ``setup.py``

- one ``simple.py`` module (no module folder) -> ``py_modules`` is properly set

- there's a ``Pipfile`` with install and dev packages

- a ``README.rst`` file

- mostly everything comes from ``simple.py``

- ``download_url`` in ``simple.py`` mentions ``{version}``
