# empty: A bare bones project

[//]: # (.. [[end long_description]])
[//]: # ( .. [[end long_description]] )

[//]: # (This is markdown comment)
[//]: # (The above tests edge case of special readme mention, surrounded by spaces vs not)
[//]: # (Only the 1st line should make it as long_description)


This example shows:

- `name` is the only thing defined in `setup.py` (and a description in its docstring)
- README file is markdown (no .rst), partially used for long_description
- `py_modules` is correctly populated due to existence of `empty.py` module
